  "description": "The atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant human-produced greenhouse gas, has increased by about 50% since pre-industrial times due to the proliferation of fossil fuel combustion. Methane (CH4) is also a strong greenhouse gas; its atmospheric abundance has more than doubled since the pre-industrial era because of human activities. Other significant greenhouse gases include nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/ghg",
