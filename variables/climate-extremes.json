  "description": "In the next decades population growth is expected to amplify current pressures on critical resources such as fresh water or food, intensify the stress on land and marine ecosystems and increase environmental pollution and its impacts on health and biodiversity. These problems will be further exacerbated by global warming and the likely impacts of climate change in the Earth system. These, including rising of the sea level, increasing levels of ocean acidification and more frequent and intense extreme events such as floods, heat waves or droughts, are expected not only to have a significant impact on critical resources, but mainly to endanger human lives and property, especially on most vulnerable populations. https://eo4society.esa.int/communities/scientists/ec-esa-joint-initiative-on-earth-system-science/",
