  "description": "Precursor species lead to the production of aerosols and ozone. Precursors include nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO). Aerosols and ozone in the near-surface atmosphere can directly harm human health and produce detrimental environmental impacts (e.g., crop damage, acid rain). Reductions in near-surface aerosols and ozone have been observed in specific regions where the emissions of some precursors are regulated. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/precursors",
