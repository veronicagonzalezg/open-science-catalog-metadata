      "description": "Society is facing today a number of global environmental challenges requiring the better understanding and monitoring of the interconnected Earth System processes. Ocean is one key gearing of this complex engine. However, knowledge gaps remain in order to better understand, characterize and monitor its role in all major Earth System global cycles (e.g. water, energy, gas, and in particular carbon, momentum cycles\u2026). To fill these gaps, dedicated research activities are needed, embracing a large number of disciplines as physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, and further exploring the interaction of the ocean with the other components of the Earth System, in particular the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere. To make the best of it, this research shall be based on the optimal and synergistic exploitation of all available observing systems (EO satellite data, in-situ and citizen observations), advanced modelling capabilities, interdisciplinary research and new technologies.",

Western Boundary Currents in particular transport heat and properties polwards, moderating climate.

Along many continental margins vertical land displacement associated with crustal adjustments to past and current land ice melt also cause regional variations in apparent sea level independent of the ocean.

In the natural system the balance among carbon in the atmosphere, land and ocean is regulated through fluxes between these three main reservoirs. In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its consequences.",
